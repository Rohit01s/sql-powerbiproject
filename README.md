#SQL-PowerBIProject

Amidst the year-end layoffs at Slice & Spice Pizzeria, a foreign pizza chain, you were unexpectedly hired as a data analyst in February 2016. 

Your senior data analyst entrusted you with the company's entire 2015 sales data, a treasure trove of information including pizza IDs, order details, pizza names, quantities, dates, times, unit prices, total prices, pizza sizes, categories, ingredients, and pizza names. 

Slice & Spice Pizzeria had a history of using past yearâ€™s sales data to optimize their business, focusing on categories with higher sales and adjusting production accordingly for upcoming year.

The senior analyst at your company has given you 2015's sales data on 5th of February 2016, a Friday. And you've been granted the entire weekend to dive deep into this huge year long sales data, and use the power of SQL to unearth hidden insights that will be pivotal for the company's strategic planning in 2016.

Your mission is to uncover valuable information that can supercharge the company's revenue, optimize outreach programs, allocate resources wisely among different pizza categories, and strategically target certain months for promotions. 

With Monday afternoon as your deadline, you're tasked with not only extracting these crucial insights but also translating them into a visually compelling and informative data dashboard using Power BI. Your insights will be the compass that guides the company's success in the year ahead.

As Friday dawns, you are poised to embark on a this project, and your destination is Monday's meeting, where you'll unveil the roadmap for the company's strategic plan for year 2016.
