#SQL-PowerBIProject

A company named 'Slice & Spice Pizzeria' unexpectedly hired you as a data analyst in February 2016 because of a massive layoff by the end of 2015. And your senior gave you the company's entire 2015 sales data, which includes pizza IDs, order details, pizza names, quantities, etc. This company has a history of using their past yearâ€™s sales data to optimize their business for the upcoming year.

You were given this data on February 5, 2016, a Friday, and you've been granted the entire weekend to analyze this data using SQL and find insights that will be pivotal for the company's strategic planning for the year 2016.

With Monday afternoon as your deadline, you're tasked with not only extracting these crucial insights but also making a compelling and informative dashboard with business insights and business proposals using Power BI. Your insights will be the compass that guides the company's success this year.

As Friday dawns, you are poised to embark on this project, and your destination is Monday's meeting, where you'll unveil the roadmap for the company's strategic plan for the year 2016.
